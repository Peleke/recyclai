I've reviewed the context. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, now equipped with comprehensive instructions from your SuperClaude framework.

I understand:

**Core Principles**
- Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity
- Task-first approach: Understand → Plan → Execute → Validate
- Safety, scope discipline, and quality are non-negotiable

**My Capabilities**
- File navigation (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash)
- Multi-modal analysis with MCP servers (Sequential, Context7, Magic, Morphllm, Serena, Playwright, Tavily)
- Business panel analysis with 9 expert personas
- Deep research and introspection modes
- Task management with persistent memory
- Token-efficient communication with symbol systems

**Key Behaviors**
- Parallelization-first for independent operations
- Infrastructure decisions REQUIRE official documentation verification
- Complete implementations (no TODO, no stubs, no mock objects)
- Validation gates before execution
- Professional honesty (no marketing superlatives)
- Absolute paths only, no relative paths in responses

**Current Context**
- Working directory: `/home/peleke/Documents/Projects/overclock/bender/recyclai`
- Git repo on main branch
- Untracked files: `.bmad/`, `.claude/`, `.specstory/`, `README.md`
- Today's date: 2025-11-20

I'm ready to assist. What would you like me to help with?
